🧠 How to Edit This Code

There are several ways you can edit and develop your application.

Option 1: Work Locally Using Your IDE

If you prefer using your own development environment (such as VS Code or WebStorm), follow these steps:

🪄 Steps
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and instant preview.
npm run dev


Once the server is running, open your browser and visit http://localhost:5173 (or the port displayed in your terminal) to preview your project live.

Option 2: Edit Files Directly on GitHub

Navigate to the desired file(s) in your repository.

Click the Edit (pencil icon) on the top right of the file view.

Make your changes and commit directly to your main branch.

Option 3: Use GitHub Codespaces

Go to your repository’s main page on GitHub.

Click on the Code (green) button near the top right.

Select the Codespaces tab.

Click New codespace to launch a cloud-based development environment.

Edit and test your code directly in the browser, then commit and push changes when ready.
